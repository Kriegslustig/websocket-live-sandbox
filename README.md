# websocket-live-sandbox
A webapp to play with websocket connections.

I put up a version of it [here](https://ws.kriegslustig.me/) and a demo [here](https://file.kriegslustig.me/ws.kriegslustig.me.m4v).

I found this to be a useful tool to debug WebSocket connections or WebSocket based protocols (ex. DDP).

## Basic Usage
Type a URL to a WebSocket (ex. `ws://echo.websocket.org`) into the top input field and press enter.
The message _Connecting to Server_ should appear.

Now you can type `'test'` into the textarea underneath and press `Ctrl+Enter`.
Now you should see _text_ and `test` in the output.

## Advanced Stuff
Please refer to the help section inside the app for more info.
